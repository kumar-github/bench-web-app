-- PERSISTENT schema change. AAFD (employees whose current project is ending soon, who will become
-- AFD — demand-supply-mapping-requirements.md's definition) gets its OWN table, not a column added
-- to supply_enriched, for two reasons confirmed against the real files (001-AFD Supply.xlsx vs.
-- 02-AAFD Supply.xlsx):
--   1. supply_enriched is documented as "fully truncated/upserted on every AFD-Supply.xlsx refresh"
--      — sharing that table would mean every refresh's truncate/upsert has to be scoped by a
--      discriminator column or one file's refresh silently wipes the other's rows. A genuinely
--      separate table makes that bug impossible instead of merely avoided-by-discipline.
--   2. The two files' columns overlap only partially (Band/Sub Band/Location/Capability/Sub
--      Capability/MAS Mapping/Skill Cluster/Skill Cluster Persona/Rating/Skill Confirmed by Emp are
--      shared concepts, sometimes under a different header name) — the rest is genuinely unique to
--      each side: AFD has Bench Ageing days/Project Code/Project Name/Assessment Status/Score with
--      no AAFD equivalent; AAFD has WPC Notice Shared on/Availability Date/Month/Customer/Reason of
--      Release/Deployment Status with no AFD equivalent. Forcing one schema would mean a wide column
--      set that's always half-NULL on either side.
--
-- Deliberately NOT classified/persona-linked like supply_enriched/demand_enriched: there is no
-- persona-resolution logic for AAFD's shape yet (RefreshLogic.classifySupply() is tuned entirely to
-- AFD's own columns and 'AFD Status' vocabulary; AAFD's own status column is a constant 'AAFD', not
-- that vocabulary at all), so this table is a faithful raw mirror of the AAFD export, upserted by
-- Emp Code, with the same is_active/inactive_since soft-delete pattern supply_enriched/demand_enriched
-- already use — not a drop-in replacement for real classification, which is still open, separate
-- future work (see demand-supply-mapping-requirements.md's "AAFD... isn't a simple extension" note).
