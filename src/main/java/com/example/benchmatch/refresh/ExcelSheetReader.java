/**
 * Stable entry point every caller (RefreshService, UploadView, and every test) already uses. The actual reading
 * logic now lives in {@code com.example.benchmatch.refresh.excel} as of 2026-10-02, when a second implementation
 * ({@code FastExcelRowReader}) was added alongside the original ({@code PoiExcelRowReader}) to fix a real
 * OutOfMemoryError on Render's free tier -- see DEPLOY.md, "Known fix #2".
 * <p>
 * This class is deliberately unchanged in its public contract: {@link #readFirstSheet(Path)} does exactly what it
 * always did, just delegating to whichever reader {@code ExcelRowReaders.active()} resolves to (POI by default --
 * see {@code ExcelRowReaders}' javadoc for how to switch, and {@code ExcelReaderComparison} in src/test for the
 * tool to verify the two readers agree on your real files before switching in production).
