 * replacement, added 2026-10-02 after a real OutOfMemoryError on Render's free tier — see DEPLOY.md). Both must
 * produce the same output for the same file; {@code ExcelReaderComparison} (in src/test) is the tool to check that
 * against your real workbooks before trusting a switch to FastExcel in production.
