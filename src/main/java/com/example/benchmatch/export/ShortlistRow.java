/**
 * One employee x demand shortlist row, carrying every field write_shortlist_workbook.py's write_employee_block()
 * needs — display fields plus the full collapsed/expanded text for all four signals (skill/band/location/assessment).
 * This is deliberately NOT MatchRow (matching.MatchRow only carries what capEmployeeRows() needs to sort/cap, by
 * design — see that record's own Javadoc) and NOT MatchCandidate (which persists only each signal's quality code,
 * not its display text — see MatchingRunService). Built fresh at export time from a live matching pass, same
 * candidate scope and cap as a matching run, so this always reflects current supply_enriched/demand_enriched data,
 * not a possibly-stale match_candidates table from an earlier run.
