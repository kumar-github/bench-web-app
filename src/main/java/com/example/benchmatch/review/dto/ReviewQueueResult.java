 * The Review queue's items plus its "no coverage" count, computed together off ONE pass over
 * match_candidates. Added 2026-10-06 specifically so {@code ReviewQueueView}'s constructor stops
 * paying for match_candidates.findAll() twice per page load (once via {@code queue()}, once via
 * the separate {@code noCoverageCount()}) — see DemandReviewService.queueAndCoverage()'s Javadoc.
 * {@code queue()} and {@code noCoverageCount()} themselves are left in place, unchanged, for their
 * other callers (DemandReviewController, DemandReviewService.nextDemandIdAfter()) that only need
 * one or the other and shouldn't have to pay for the half they don't.
